## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- `VulnerabilityFactory::fromList()` now silently drops non-array entries from
  the decoded LLM payload (with a `warning`-level log carrying the offender's
  `get_debug_type`). The attacker chunk-analysis path previously assumed
  `LLMResponse::parseJson()` always returned a list of dicts; when the
  tool-using loop exhausted its iteration cap or the model emitted a malformed
  payload, scalar entries (string, int, null) interleaved with the expected
  vulnerability dicts surfaced as a `TypeError` from `fromArray()` and aborted
  the entire chunk. The guard now matches the `fromList silently drops nulls`
  contract documented in `.claude/rules/llm-seam.md`. Phpdoc on `fromArray`
  relaxed from `array<string, mixed>` to `array<array-key, mixed>` and on
  `fromList` from `list<array<string, mixed>>` to `list<mixed>` so the static
  type matches the runtime tolerance.
- `RegexSecretScrubber::scrub()` no longer redacts Symfony configuration
  indirections inside otherwise-credentialed assignments. Quoted values matching
  a Symfony parameter reference (`%env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)%`,
  `%env(string:DB_PASSWORD)%`, `%kernel.secret%`) or a shell-style env expansion
  (`$NAME`, `${NAME}`) are now passed through unmodified by the
  `inline_assignment` pattern, while literal secrets and the other pattern
  families (AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Slack, Google, JWT, PEM, `env_assignment`) keep
  their existing behavior. Previously, code following the recommended Symfony
  secrets workflow (`api_key: '%env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)%'`) was reported to the
  LLM as `api_key: '***REDACTED:inline_assignment***'`, which the attacker then
  escalated to a CRITICAL "hardcoded credential" finding — a false positive on
  the documented best practice. Implementation switched the `inline_assignment`
  arm from `preg_replace` to `preg_replace_callback` so the placeholder check
  can short-circuit per match without affecting the other patterns.
- `AttackerPromptBuilder::basePrompt()` now carries a "Tool Usage Discipline"
  section instructing the model that (1) it has a limited, finite tool-call
  budget per chunk, (2) it must stop using tools and emit the final JSON the
  moment evidence is sufficient, (3) it must emit `[]` immediately when the
  initial scan surfaces no findings rather than continuing to call tools "just
  to be thorough", and (4) any prose, reasoning, or further tool call emitted
  after the answer-decision causes the response to be discarded as malformed.
  Real-world audits were exhausting the `max_tool_iterations` budget (default
  `8`) on Read/Grep/ListFiles/LookupAdvisory calls without ever emitting a final
  answer, leaving downstream consumers with reasoning prose instead of a
  vulnerability list. `PROMPT_VERSION` bumped from `1` to `2` so the attacker
  cache key (which folds in the prompt version) invalidates previously-cached
  responses produced under the old prompt.
- `LLMResponse::parseJson()` JSON-block recovery no longer locks on the first
  `[`/`{` it sees. The new algorithm iterates every opener position outside JSON
  string literals, attempts `scanBalancedBlockFrom` + `json_decode` at each, and
  returns the first block that decodes successfully; the original
  `JsonException` is rethrown only when no candidate block decodes. Recovery is
  skipped entirely when the trimmed content is itself a single balanced block,
  preserving the depth-limit semantics of the top-level decode (which already
  attempted exactly that payload) and preventing silent acceptance of shallower
  inner sub-blocks inside malformed top-level JSON. Models that wrap their final
  answer in prose containing PHP-style array access (e.g.
  `recommendation.contents[locale]`) followed by a trailing `[]` previously had
  the answer dropped — the first `[` was extracted as `[locale]`, failed to
  decode, and the recovery never tried the actual JSON tail.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-26

### Tooling

- Mutation gate now kills the `UnwrapTrim` and `ArrayOneItem` mutants escaping
  the LLM seam (`LLMResponse::parseJson()` markdown-fence stripping path). Added
  targeted unit tests that pin the trimmed payload around the JSON block and
  that the recovery path returns the decoded array (not the wrapping list) after
  stripping fences. No production code change.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- New `scan.included_paths` configuration key (`string[]`, default
  `['src', 'config', 'templates', 'public/index.php']`) is the **sole scoping
  knob** for the audit. Only the listed project-relative directories and files
  are inspected; everything else — `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `var/`, `tests/`,
  `migrations/`, `translations/`, `bin/`, root scripts, IDE folders, build
  artefacts, monorepo siblings — is silently skipped. Symfony Finder is invoked
  with the resolved directories as its `in()` roots so it never traverses
  outside the allow-list. If none of the entries resolve in the project root the
  scanner logs `No included paths exist in project` at `warning` level and
  returns an empty result.

### Changed

- The explicit-file leg of `ProjectFileScanner` now routes through Symfony
  Finder (`->in(dirname)->depth('== 0')->name(basename)->size('<= NKi')`)
  instead of a hand-rolled `filesize() > kb * 1024` check, so both legs of the
  scanner share a single size-comparison implementation.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `scan.excluded_dirs` configuration key. The previous deny-list
  mechanism (hard defaults plus user-supplied exclusions) has been replaced by
  `scan.included_paths`. To prune a sub-tree inside an included path (e.g. drop
  `src/Migrations`), tighten `included_paths` to specific sub-directories:

  ```yaml
  symfony_security_auditor:
      scan:
          included_paths: ['src/Controller', 'src/Form', 'src/Voter']
  ```

- **Breaking:** the internal `HARD_EXCLUDED_DIRS` list on `ProjectFileScanner`
  and its `additionalExcludedDirs` constructor parameter are gone. With Finder
  scanning only included paths, walking into `vendor/` or `node_modules/` no
  longer happens, so the prune list is unnecessary.

### Fixed

- `scan.max_file_size_kb` now interprets the unit as kibibytes (`1024`-byte
  blocks) for both directory-scanned and explicitly-listed paths. The previous
  implementation routed the directory scan through Symfony Finder's `K` suffix
  (`1000`-byte kilobytes) while the explicit-file path used `*1024`, so files
  between `1000 * N` and `1024 * N` bytes were treated differently depending on
  which leg of the scanner saw them. Both paths now share the `Ki` suffix.
- `LLMResponse::parseJson()` now recovers from conversational prose around a
  balanced JSON block. With `audit.tools_enabled: true` (the default), the
  attacker model sometimes ignores the "Return ONLY the JSON array" prompt
  instruction and wraps its answer in commentary, which previously caused a
  whole chunk's findings to be dropped with `JsonException: Syntax error`.
- `AttackerAgent` / `ReviewerAgent` parse-failure error logs now include a
  512-byte `content_preview` of the LLM response so the actual shape of an
  unrecoverable payload is diagnosable without re-running the audit.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- `SymfonyAiLLMClient` now omits the `temperature` option from the platform
  invocation unless the host has explicitly configured one. Forwarding the
  default `temperature: 1.0` was rejected by reasoning-only models (notably
  GPT-5) which require the platform's own default, surfacing as a
  `temperature does not support` provider error before any chunk could be
  analyzed. The option is still forwarded verbatim when set, so existing
  configurations keep their previous behavior.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- `audit:run --path=<subdir>` (repeatable, shortcut `-p`) restricts the scan to
  one or several project-relative subdirectories. The project root remains the
  argument (or working directory), so advisory lookups still see
  `composer.lock`. Useful for monorepos where only a single app needs to be
  audited.
- `audit:run --no-cache` bypasses the attacker cache for the run: every chunk
  hits the LLM and no cache entries are written or read. Existing cache stays on
  disk untouched.
- New `Audit\Domain\Port\ProgressReporterInterface` plus two ready-to-use
  implementations (`NullProgressReporter`, `LoggerProgressReporter`). The audit
  pipeline now emits `pipeline.started`, `stage.started`, `stage.completed`, and
  `pipeline.completed` events so hosts can render progress without polling.
  Default is `NullProgressReporter` — silent unless the host wires another
  implementation.
- `CharacterBasedTokenEstimator` now covers Mistral / Codestral, Llama
  (`llama-*`, `llama3*`, `llama4*`, `meta-llama/*`), and DeepSeek model families
  in addition to Claude / GPT (incl. `o3` / `o4`) / Gemini. The constructor
  accepts an optional `$charsPerTokenByPrefix` map so hosts can add or override
  ratios for fine-tuned or self-hosted models without subclassing.
- `AuditCost` carries an optional per-role breakdown (`byRole()`, also surfaced
  under `by_role` in `toArray()`). `EstimateAuditCostUseCase` now computes
  attacker and reviewer cost separately and populates the breakdown, so
  `audit:run --dry-run` reports show `$X for the attacker model` and
  `$Y for the reviewer model` instead of a single bundled total. The console
  template renders the breakdown automatically when present.
- New `Audit\Domain\Port\RateLimiterInterface` plus two ready-to-use
  implementations (`NullRateLimiter`, `TokenBucketRateLimiter`). Wrapped around
  every LLM call, the limiter blocks ahead of time so the audit stays inside the
  provider's per-minute quota instead of relying on reactive 429 retries. Three
  independent dimensions track requests-per-minute, input-tokens-per-minute and
  output-tokens-per-minute; each is independently nullable.
- New
  `audit.rate_limit.{requests_per_minute, input_tokens_per_minute, output_tokens_per_minute}`
  configuration keys (all `int|null`, default `null`). When every dimension is
  `null` (the default) the bundle wires `NullRateLimiter` and behavior matches
  the pre-existing retry-only path; setting any dimension wires
  `TokenBucketRateLimiter` keyed by the configured limits. Recommended starting
  point for Anthropic Tier 1 is `requests_per_minute: 50`,
  `input_tokens_per_minute: 500_000`, `output_tokens_per_minute: 80_000` on
  Opus, scaled down for Haiku/Sonnet.
- `RetryAfterHeaderParser` reads the server-issued `Retry-After` hint from
  `Symfony\AI\Platform\Exception\RateLimitExceededException::getRetryAfter()`
  (or a `retry-after: <int>` substring in the chained messages) and feeds it
  into `RetryPolicy::rateLimitDelayMs()` plus
  `RateLimiterInterface::pauseUntil()`. Chunks scheduled after a 429 share the
  freeze instead of stampeding the provider.
- `RetryPolicy::rateLimitDelayMs()` now accepts an optional
  `?int $serverHintSeconds`. When set and positive, the hint wins over the local
  exponential schedule; the result is clamped to `rateLimitMaxDelayMs` (default
  `300_000`) so a hostile provider cannot push the wait past a sane ceiling.
  `null` hints preserve the existing exponential behavior.
- README now opens with a 30-second quick-start section above the full Getting
  Started guide.

### Changed

- The attacker cache key now folds in the configured attacker model name and a
  prompt-builder version constant (`AttackerPromptBuilder::PROMPT_VERSION`).
  Switching models or bumping the prompt automatically invalidates
  previously-cached LLM responses; identical configuration across instances
  still hits the cache as before.
- `composer audit` results are now persisted to disk across runs, keyed by a
  SHA-256 of the project's `composer.lock`. Re-running the audit (CI, repeated
  `--dry-run`) reuses the cached advisory data instead of spawning composer
  again. Projects without a lockfile transparently fall back to running the
  underlying audit on every call; cache I/O failures are logged and swallowed.
- `SymfonyAiLLMClient::invokeWithRetry()` now eagerly resolves the
  `Symfony\AI\Platform\Result\DeferredResult` returned by `platform->invoke()`
  before exiting the retry block. Previously the wrapped HTTP body was read
  lazily by `asText()` / `getResult()` in `complete()` / `completeWithTools()`,
  so transient failures emitted by `symfony/http-client`'s deferred body read
  escaped the retry classifier — most visibly, `HTTP 429` responses bypassed the
  rate-limit-specific backoff. Eager resolution surfaces those failures inside
  the retry loop so backoff, retry-after hints, and budget enforcement all
  behave as documented.

### Fixed

- `audit:run` no longer crashes on the first chunk that draws a `429`. The
  combination of eager `DeferredResult` resolution plus the new rate-limit
  pipeline (`RateLimiterInterface`, server-hint backoff) means rate-limited
  responses now flow through retry + pause instead of escaping as a raw
  `\Throwable` to the agent layer.

### Tooling

- Dev dependency `phpunit/phpunit` bumped from `^11.5` to `^12.5`. PHPUnit 12
  drops the abandoned `sebastian/code-unit` and
  `sebastian/code-unit-reverse-lookup` transitives so `composer audit` no longer
  reports abandoned-package warnings on a fresh install. Supported PHP range is
  unchanged (`>=8.3`); test runner setup is otherwise compatible.
- New runtime dependency `psr/clock` (the abstract `ClockInterface` the bucket
  consumes). New dev dependency `symfony/clock` (provides `MockClock` for the
  time-driven `TokenBucketRateLimiter` tests).
- `castor.php` PHPUnit step drops the legacy `-d --min-coverage=100` PHPUnit CLI
  flag — PHPUnit 12 no longer accepts the unknown option; coverage enforcement
  is delegated to `robiningelbrecht/phpunit-coverage-tools` (already wired in
  `phpunit.dist.xml`). The Infection step now passes `-d memory_limit=1G` to
  clear the 128 MB default on the larger mutant tree.

### Notes

- All changes in this release are additive — existing public APIs (configuration
  keys, `audit:run` arguments / options / exit codes, JSON and SARIF schemas,
  Domain ports) keep their previous signatures. New optional constructor
  parameters on `AuditCost`, `AuditContext::forProject()`,
  `EstimateAuditCostUseCase`, `RunAuditUseCase::execute()`,
  `FilesystemAttackerCache`, and `SymfonyAiLLMClient` all default to their
  previous behavior.
- `ProgressReporterInterface` and `RateLimiterInterface` are Domain ports
  covered by the BC promise (see `docs/versioning.md`). For
  `ProgressReporterInterface`, host implementations should expect new event
  names to be added in `MINOR` releases (additive) but never have their payload
  schemas changed without a `MAJOR`. `TokenBucketRateLimiter` state is
  per-process: multi-process audits sharing one API key (parallel CI matrices)
  still race on the provider window — out-of-process coordination (Redis/file
  lock) can be added by implementing `RateLimiterInterface` and aliasing it in
  `config/services.yaml`.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Mutation gate now kills the `MethodCallRemoval` mutant on the
  `logReviewDecision()` call inside the rejected-finding early-return branch of
  `ReviewerAgent::applyReview()`. Existing tests covered the accepted /
  severity-elevated paths but left the rejection-path debug log unasserted, so
  removing the call escaped Infection — added a targeted unit test that
  exercises a rejected review and asserts the `'Vulnerability reviewed'` debug
  entry is emitted with `accepted => false`. No production code change.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- `Vulnerability::withCorrectedType()` — copy-on-write reclassification when the
  reviewer determines the attacker mislabelled the finding's type. The original
  `id` is preserved so downstream consumers can still correlate the corrected
  record with its pre-correction source.
- Reviewer prompt accepts a `corrected_type` field (nullable string) per
  finding; `ReviewerAgent` parses it, validates against `VulnerabilityType`, and
  applies it via `withCorrectedType()`. Invalid values are logged and ignored —
  original type is preserved.
- New configuration key `symfony_security_auditor.provider_json_mode` (boolean,
  default `false`). When `true`, every LLM call carries
  `response_format: {type: json_object}` to the underlying provider — honored by
  OpenAI / Mistral / Ollama (provider-enforced JSON output), silently ignored by
  Anthropic and any provider without an equivalent knob. The prompt contract
  (_"Return ONLY the JSON array"_) remains authoritative; this is a
  belt-and-braces opt-in for providers that support it.

### Changed

- Prompt builders restructured for accuracy: source files are now wrapped as
  `<file path="…" type="…">…</file>` with each line prefixed by its line number
  in the form `` `NNN | ` ``. The attacker prompt instructs the model to use
  those exact line numbers for `line_start` / `line_end` instead of counting
  manually. Skill blocks switched from `### Heading` to
  `<skills role="…">…</skills>` form and are emitted in attack-surface priority
  order rather than alphabetically.
- Attacker base prompt now includes a severity rubric, a confidence rubric (with
  a hard `< 0.6` filter threshold), a single canonical few-shot example with
  concrete line numbers, and an explicit scope exclusion for `vendor/`,
  `var/cache/`, `var/log/`, `.generated.*`, and `.cache.*` paths.
- Each per-artifact skill block now lists both attack patterns to hunt and
  patterns explicitly NOT to flag — reduces false positives from the attacker
  agent before the reviewer ever sees them.
- Reviewer prompts (single and batch) now share a common core-instructions block
  to prevent drift, include the same severity rubric as the attacker, and embed
  a Symfony-specific false-positive playbook (Doctrine `setParameter()`, default
  CSRF, `mapped: false` form fields, hardcoded-argv `Process` invocations,
  `_profiler` gated by `when@dev`, etc.). Batch mode no longer requires findings
  to be returned in input order — entries are re-keyed by `id` on parse.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-24

First stable release.

### Added

#### Core audit pipeline

- **Multi-agent security audit pipeline**: Ingestion → Mapping → Audit, driven
  by an adversarial **Attacker** agent and a skeptical **Reviewer** agent (up to
  3 iterations; stops early when no new findings emerge).
- **Provider-agnostic LLM backend** via
  [`symfony/ai`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/ai/index.html): works out of
  the box with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, Google
  Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, DeepSeek, Mistral, Meta (Llama), and Ollama (local).
  Swapping providers requires only `config/packages/ai.yaml` changes.
- **32 vulnerability types** across 6 OWASP-aligned categories: Injection,
  Broken Access Control, Logic Flaws, Symfony-specific, Data Exposure,
  Cryptographic.
- **Split-model support** — pair a larger model for attack discovery with a
  faster, cheaper model for review (e.g. `attacker_model: claude-opus-4-7` +
  `reviewer_model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).

#### `audit:run` console command

- Three output formats: `console` (human-readable), `json` (machine-readable),
  `sarif` (SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning and GitLab Security Dashboard).
- `--output` option writes JSON or SARIF to a file path.
- `--dry-run` flag estimates token usage and cost without invoking the LLM.
  Exits `0` with zero findings and a populated `cost` block.
- Exit codes: `0` audit complete (SAFE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), `1` CRITICAL risk or
  invalid project path, `2` token or cost budget exceeded (partial report
  emitted).

#### Token & cost tracking

- Real token usage (input, output, cached tokens) recorded from platform
  response metadata on every LLM call.
- `AuditReport` carries a `cost` block: total tokens and estimated USD cost.
- Character-based token estimator (`CharacterBasedTokenEstimator`) using
  `mb_strlen` for correct multibyte handling on providers without token counts.

#### Budget cap

- Hard token and cost budget enforced via `audit.budget.max_tokens` and
  `audit.budget.max_cost_usd`. Audit aborts cleanly with exit code `2` and emits
  a partial report when either limit is exceeded. Both default to `null`
  (unlimited).

#### Resilience — retry with exponential backoff

- Jittered exponential backoff around every LLM call. Transient errors (HTTP
  429, 5xx, network blips) are retried; non-transient errors (auth, validation)
  fail fast. Configurable: `audit.retry.max_attempts` (3),
  `audit.retry.initial_delay_ms` (500), `audit.retry.backoff_multiplier` (2.0),
  `audit.retry.jitter_ratio` (0.2).

#### Security — credential scrubbing

- Credential-shaped strings (AWS/GitHub/Stripe/Slack/Google API keys, JWTs, PEM
  private keys, env-style assignments) are redacted from file content before
  reaching any LLM provider. Enabled by default
  (`scan.secret_scrubbing.enabled: true`); extensible via
  `scan.secret_scrubbing.additional_patterns`.

#### Attacker tools

- `read_file`, `grep`, `list_files` — cross-file investigation tools.
- `lookup_advisory` — live CVE feed via `composer audit --format=json --locked`.
  Degrades gracefully (empty database + `warning` log) when `composer` or
  `composer.lock` is absent.

#### Caching

- Content-hash filesystem cache for attacker chunks (`cache.enabled: true`);
  skips the LLM call entirely when an identical chunk was analyzed before.
- Provider-side prompt caching via `cache_control: ephemeral`
  (`cache.prompt_caching: true`); honored by Anthropic (~90% input-token
  discount), silently ignored by others.

#### Bundle configuration

- Typed Configuration value objects for all bundle settings (replaces raw array
  access throughout the bundle).
- Full YAML configuration surface under `symfony_security_auditor:`:
  - `model` / `attacker_model` / `reviewer_model`
  - `scan.*`: `excluded_dirs`, `respect_gitignore`, `max_file_size_kb`,
    `secret_scrubbing.*`
  - `audit.*`: `max_iterations`, `min_confidence`, `reviewer_batch_size`,
    `tools_enabled`, `max_tool_iterations`, `budget.*`, `retry.*`
  - `cache.*`: `enabled`, `dir`, `prompt_caching`

#### Architecture

- Strict DDD layering: `Command → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure`.
  `LLMClientInterface` is the sole seam between Application and `symfony/ai`; no
  agent imports any `symfony/ai` type directly.
- Domain ports (`LLMClientInterface`, `AttackerCacheInterface`,
  `ProjectFileScannerInterface`, `*PromptBuilderInterface`, `Tool/*`) live in
  `src/Audit/Domain/Port/`.
- All non-extension-point classes tagged `@internal`.

#### Extension points

`LLMClientInterface`, `AdvisoryDatabaseInterface`,
`AttackerPromptBuilderInterface`, `ReviewerPromptBuilderInterface`,
`ProjectFileScannerInterface`, `AttackerCacheInterface`, `ToolInterface`,
`PipelineInterface`, `StageInterface`. See
[`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md).

#### Documentation

  domain model, extension points.
- [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) — full bundle configuration
  reference.

### Changed

- `AdvisoryDatabaseInterface` moved from `Audit\Infrastructure\Advisory\` to
  `Audit\Domain\Port\`. The interface is a public extension point, so its
  canonical home is the Domain port namespace alongside `LLMClientInterface`,
  `AttackerCacheInterface`, etc. Host applications aliasing the interface in
  `config/services.yaml` must update the FQCN; concrete implementations
  (`ComposerAuditAdvisoryDatabase`, `InMemoryAdvisoryDatabase`) keep their
  existing FQCNs in `Infrastructure\`.
- Default model updated from `claude-opus-4-5` (retired) to `claude-opus-4-7`.
- Default reviewer model updated from `claude-haiku-4-5` (retired) to
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
- **Pricing table corrected**: Anthropic Claude 4 Opus prices were set to the
  Claude 3 Opus rate (`$15.00 / $75.00` per MTok) — corrected to the actual
  Claude 4 Opus rate (`$5.00 / $25.00` per MTok input/output). Haiku and Sonnet
  entries unchanged. Existing cost estimates in CI reports will recalculate at
  the correct rate once updated.
- Pricing table extended with additional current and legacy model entries:
  `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`,
  `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-1`, `claude-opus-4` (deprecated alias),
  `claude-sonnet-4` (deprecated alias), `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`,
  `gemini-2.0-flash`, `mistral-large`. Legacy `claude-opus-4-5` /
  `claude-haiku-4-5` entries retained for cost reporting on existing
  configurations.

### Fixed

- Budget exceptions now rethrown from `AttackerAgent` so abort propagates to the
  pipeline and triggers exit code `2`.
- SARIF `tool.driver.version` previously hardcoded; now resolved from installed
  Composer metadata at runtime.
- `RegexSecretScrubber` replaced `set_error_handler`/`try-finally` around PCRE
  calls with a leading `@` suppressor — eliminates `UnwrapFinally`/`TrueValue`
  mutation escapes and removes dead early-return path.
- Non-transient LLM failures (missing platform configuration, auth errors,
  retired model names) now abort the audit with exit code `1` and a clear error
  message instead of silently producing a false-negative SAFE result. Introduced
  `Audit\Domain\Exception\LLMProviderException` as the catchable Domain type;
  `AttackerAgent` and `ReviewerAgent` rethrow it rather than swallowing it.

### Compatibility

| Axis                | Requirement      |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| PHP                 | `^8.3`           |
| Symfony             | `^7.4 \|\| ^8.0` |
| `symfony/ai-bundle` | `^0.9`           |

CI test matrix: PHP 8.3 / 8.4 / 8.5 × Symfony 7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1.

### Notes

- Default model is `claude-opus-4-7`. Change via `model:`, `attacker_model:`, or
  `reviewer_model:`.
- Register bundle in `dev` and `test` environments only (per
  `config/bundles.php` guidance in the README).
